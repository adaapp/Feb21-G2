## The Project Of Ethan, Luke and Yasameen.

## Aims for the project
### Our main goal is to provide a safe online environment where carers and members of dimensions can access resources to facilitate themselves and others to become more independent, an interactive library that has endless opportunities.

## Our objectives for the project
### User can login using username and answer to question 
### User can click on category and find associated resources 
### User can show their reaction to resource using button on library page
### Reaction (e.g. Smiley face)  should be shown the chatbox next userâ€™s name
### Resource link once clicked should take the user to the resource page 

## Database
### For our database we decided to use a relational database, using the sqlite language. We created the tables separately on an external website with a testing environment called sqlfiddle (http://sqlfiddle.com/#!5/3d77b/8). Once we had working tables we connected the database to the back end using a function we called connect and get requests to access the database. We then used an inbuilt function called run to insert the data in to the database which included all our tables and queries. The data to be entered was determined by using an ERD we created, using the entities from our physical model to structure our table. As a MVP there were only limited amounts of data inserted into the table, just enough to showcase basic functionality.

## Implementing design 
### Using a visually engaging colour scheme to aid our users to have an easy and fun experience. Using the government website; Accessible communication formats and Easy Read, we've been able to understand how to acheive this. Furthermore, we aimed to use not only text that would be easily read by the user but also objects of reference to help the user navigate the website.
